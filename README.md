Gnuplot Examples
----------------

This project is created for learning purpose.

I was looking for a simple, battery-included plotting utility to implement a software profiling toolkit at work. Gnuplot stood out of all the candidates because:

- It creates decent 2D graphs. 

- It has the least amount of dependencies. I can either download and unzip the binary or build it from the source. After that it is fully functional.

- It uses text files as the main source of input data. This greatly simplifies the tooling. 

- It is "hackable" via scripting but does not force the users to learn another programming language.

This project is loosely based on the examples in [Gnuplot in Action, second edition](https://www.manning.com/books/gnuplot-in-action-second-edition).

To run all the examples, you are expected to use a Linux distribution that has:

- X-window manager

- installed bash and Python (/bin/bash, /usr/bin/python)

- a functional gnuplot 5.0+
