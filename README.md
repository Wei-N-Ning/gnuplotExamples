Gnuplot Examples
----------------

This project is created for (my) learning purpose.

I was looking for a simple, battery-included plotting utility to implement a software profiling toolkit at work. Gnuplot standed out of all the candidates because:

- It creates decent 2D graphs. 

- It has the least amount of dependencies. I can either download and unzip the binary or build it from the source. After that it is fully functional.

- It uses text file as the input data file. This greatly simplifies the tooling. 

- It is "hackable" via scripting but does not force the users to learn another programming language.

This project is loosely based on the examples in Gnuplot in Action, second edition.

To run all the examples you are expected to use a Linux distribution that has:

- X-window manager

- installed bash and Python (/bin/bash, /usr/bin/python)

- a functional gnuplot 5.0+
